- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @stephanie-reyn
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in playing video games, crocheting and going to the gym. I love to travel as well.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C# and to be a full stack developer (one day)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me on discord!
- âš¡ Dad joke: I got fired by Microsoft :( But I excel in finding new jobs. This is because I have a way with words, and a positive outlook in life.
